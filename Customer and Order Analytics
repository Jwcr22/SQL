In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

-- How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT (orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'orderID';

-- How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'orderID'
AND product = 'iPhone';

-- Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS feb_sales
ON customers.order_id=feb_sales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'orderID';

-- Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

-- What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue, Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

-- Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

-- How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(cust.acctnum) AS count, AVG(Quantity*price) AS avg_price
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderID=feb.orderID
WHERE feb.quantity >2
AND LENGTH(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

-- List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold
SELECT Product, SUM(Product)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%los angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;

-- Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?
SELECT DISTINCT location, COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%new york%'
AND LENGTH(orderID) =6
AND orderID <> '%order%'
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderID) >2;

-- How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) as quantity
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Product LIKE '%headphone%'
GROUP BY Product;

-- What was the average amount spent per account in February?
SELECT SUM(price*Quantity)/COUNT(cust.acctnum) as avg_per_acct
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> '%order%';

-- What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?
SELECT SUM(Quantity)/COUNT(cust.acctnum) as avg_qty
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> '%order%';

-- Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT Product, SUM(price*Quantity) as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY SUM(price*Quantity) DESC
LIMIT 1;
