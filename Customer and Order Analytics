In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

SELECT COUNT (orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'orderID';

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'orderID'
AND product = 'iPhone';

SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS feb_sales
ON customers.order_id=feb_sales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'orderID';

SELECT DISTINCT Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;
